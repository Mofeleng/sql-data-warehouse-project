-- =======================================================
-- Load Cleaned Sales Data into Silver Layer (crm_sales_details)
-- This script transforms and loads validated CRM sales data.
-- Transformations applied:
-- 1. Date columns: Convert 8-digit integers (YYYYMMDD) to DATE, replace 0s or malformed with NULL
-- 2. Price correction: Replace missing or invalid prices with derived price (sales รท quantity)
-- 3. Sales correction: Ensure sales = quantity ร price if original value is null, <= 0, or incorrect
-- 4. No changes made to quantity or keys (assumed validated in bronze checks)
